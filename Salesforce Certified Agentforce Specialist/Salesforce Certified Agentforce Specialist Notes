Main Types of AI Capabilities
  Language Processing
  Numeric Predictions
  Classifications
  Robotic Navigation
  AI Models and Neural Networks

Artificial intelligence is the ability for a computer to perform skills typically associated with human intuition, inference, and reasoning. Many of these skills fall into broad categories like numeric predictions and language processing that are making their way into our lives through AI that supports our business use cases, educational needs, and industrial purposes.

Possibilities of Language Models (LLMs)
  Summarization
  Translation
  Error Correction
  Question Answering
  Guided Image Generation
  Text-to-Speech

Factors
  availability of huge amounts of training data
  better training
  computational power

Common Concerns About Generative AI
  Hallucinations
  Data Security
  Plagiarism
  User Spoofing
  Sustainability

Generative AI is capable of assisting businesses and individuals alike with all sorts of language-based tasks. The convergence of lots of data, clever AI architecture, and huge amounts of computing power has supercharged generative AI development and the growth of the AI ecosystem.

Data processed from unstructured to structured is called natural language understanding (NLU).
Data processed the reverse way–from structured to unstructured–is called natural language generation (NLG). NLG is what enables AI assistants to generate human-like language.
Neural networks recognize patterns, words, and phrases to make language processing exponentially faster and more contextually accurate.

Elements of natural language in English include:
  Vocabulary: The words we use
  Grammar: The rules governing sentence structure
  Syntax: How words are combined to form sentences according to grammar
  Semantics: The meaning of words, phrases, and sentences
  Pragmatics: The context and intent behind cultural or geographic language use
  Discourse and dialogue: Units larger than a single phrase or sentence, including documents and conversations
  Phonetics and phonology: The sounds we make when we communicate
  Morphology: How parts of words can be combined or uncombined to make new words

Syntactic parsing may include:
  Segmentation
  Tokenization
  Stemming
  Lemmatization
  Part of speech tagging
  Named entity recognition (NER)

Common analysis techniques, used in extracting valuable insights from text and speech data, that are used in NLP:
  Sentiment analysis
  Intent analysis
  Context (discourse) analysis

LLMs are advanced computer models designed to understand and generate human-like text. They're trained on vast amounts of text data to learn patterns, language structures, and relationships between words and sentences.

LLMs vary by size, but they typically contain billions of parameters. Parameters are the factors that the model learns during its training process, building the model’s understanding of language.

Artificial Intelligence Technologies
  Machine learning uses various mathematical algorithms to get insights from data and make predictions.
  Deep learning uses a specific type of algorithm called a neural network to find associations between a set of inputs and outputs. Deep learning becomes more effective and efficient as the amount of data increases.
  Natural language processing is a technology that enables machines to take human language as an input and perform actions accordingly.
  Large language models are advanced computer models designed to understand and generate humanlike text.
  Computer vision is technology that enables machines to interpret visual information.
  Robotics is a technology that enables machines to perform physical tasks.

Machine learning (ML) classification
  Supervised learning
  Unsupervised learning
  Reinforcement learning

Limitations of Machine Learning
  Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization.
  Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple and does not capture the underlying patterns in the data.
  Bias occurs when the model is trained on data that is not representative of the real-world population.

Machine learning is limited by the quality and quantity of data used, lack of transparency in complex models, difficulty in generalizing to new situations, challenges with handling missing data, and potential for biased predictions.

Predictive AI
  Can make accurate predictions based on labeled data
  Can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and customer churn prediction
  Limited by the quality and quantity of labeled data available
  May struggle with making predictions outside of the labeled data it was trained on
  May require significant computational resources to train and deploy
Generative AI
  Can generate new and creative content
  Can be used in a wide range of creative applications, such as art, music, and writing
  Can generate biased or inappropriate content based on the input data
  May struggle with understanding context or generating coherent content
  May not be suitable for all applications, such as those that require accuracy and precision

Limitations of Generative AI
may generate biased or inappropriate responses based on the data it was trained on.
may also struggle with understanding user input context or generating coherent responses

Data Lifecycle for AI
  Data collection: In this stage, data is collected from various sources, such as sensors, surveys, and online sources.
  Data storage: Once data is collected, it must be stored securely.
  Data processing: In this stage, data is processed to extract insights and patterns. This may include using machine learning algorithms or other data analysis techniques.
  Data use: Once the data has been processed, it can be used for its intended purpose, such as making decisions or informing policy.
  Data sharing: At times, it may be necessary to share data with other organizations or individuals.
  Data retention: Data retention refers to the length of time that data is kept.
  Data disposal: Once data is no longer needed, it needs to be disposed of securely. This may involve securely deleting digital data or destroying physical media.

Some examples of ethical issues in data collection and analysis
  Privacy violations
  Data breaches
  Bias

Strategies to promote data privacy and confidentiality
  Encryption
  Anonymization
  Access controls

Addressing bias and promoting fairness requires a range of strategies
  Diversifying data sources
  Improving data quality
  Conducting bias audits
  Incorporating fairness metrics
  Promoting transparency

Data protection laws and regulations
  The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA): A set of regulations that apply to companies that do business in California and collect the personal data of California residents.
  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): A set of regulations that apply to healthcare organizations and govern the use and disclosure of protected health information in the United States.
  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A set of regulations that apply to all organizations that process the personal data of European Union residents.
  European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act): Comprehensive AI regulations banning systems with unacceptable risk and giving specific legal requirements for high-risk applications.

Use merge fields to connect your prompt templates to Salesforce record fields, such as from sales or service records.
Use Flow Builder to create dynamic prompt fragments that go way beyond linking record fields. Flows let you add complex logic to a prompt that helps you include exactly the data you need.

Ask the Right Questions when preparing Prompt Template
  Who is involved, and how are they related? [Key Ingredients: Participants, relationships, data]
  What are you trying to accomplish? [Key Ingredients: Goal, instructions]
  What is the context? [Key Ingredients: Setting, tone & style, language]
  What are the constraints? [Key Ingredients: Limits, instructions]

Prompt Builder
Templates
  Sales Email prompt templates - help your team draft truly personalized emails for your customers, products, and events based on record data.
  Field Generation prompt templates - bring generative AI-assisted workflows to custom fields within a Salesforce record.
  Record Summary prompt templates - create a rich-text summary for a Salesforce record based on the record’s data.
  Flex prompt templates - generate content for business purposes not covered by other prompt template types, allowing you to define your own resources.

Grounding is a technique used in large language models to provide external, verifiable information to the model, which helps ensure that the prompt responses are accurate, relevant, and specific to the given context, rather than relying solely on the model's pre-existing training data.

To create a sales email prompt template in Prompt Builder, you need the Einstein for Sales, Einstein for Platform, or Einstein for Service add-on.

Use merge fields, Apex, and Flow as resources to enable Prompt Builder to securely access Salesforce data.

If you want to use data from a SOQL query or an external API in your prompt, consider Apex. Apex is also effective if you want to generate well-formatted JSON or do programmatic data filtering.

With the help of Lightning App Builder (LAB), an Einstein button (“Einstein button icon”) can trigger an assigned prompt template to send a prompt to the LLM and return a response back to the specific field.

Flow Builder, admins can create Template-Triggered Prompt Flows to incorporate complex logic in prompt templates without writing any code.

Considerations After Generating a Prompt Response / Guardrails
  Topical Relevance - The model’s response must be grammatically correct within the ongoing conversation and directly relevant with the overall request in the prompt.
  Action/Goal Completion - Assess if the response aligns with the intended action, fulfills the goal of the prompt, and satisfies the user's need by addressing everything the prompt requests.
  Register/Tonal Appropriateness - When evaluating model output, consider whether the tone of voice or style is appropriate for the interaction between the response and the user. Ensure the vocabulary, punctuation, and style fit the needs of your end user.
  Factual Accuracy - When reviewing model output, watch for inaccuracies or hallucinations. Check if it correctly uses prompt data and avoids including unintended specifics.
  Repetition - Consider the extent of variation in the response for your specific use case. Evaluate whether it meets your expectations. Consider if repetitive vocabulary is acceptable for tighter compliance. Also, decide if it’s OK if multiple responses sound the same or use the same terms.
  Toxicity - Review the response for any potentially harmful content, such as offensive, disrespectful, or abusive language that could negatively impact the user experience.
  Bias/Ethics "Verify that the response promotes fairness and inclusivity.
  Examine the response for subtle biases in language. Ensure it doesn’t:
    Assume gender identity based on their name alone.
    Sideline participants with disabilities.
    Display assumptions about race or socioeconomic status."

Data Masking
  Data masking for LLMs is currently disabled for agents.
  For embedded generative AI features, such as Einstein Service Replies, Einstein Work Summaries data masking is available.
Prompt Defense
  can help protect from prompt injection(get around restrictions and attempt to perform tasks or manipulate the model’s output in ways that the model wasn’t designed to handle.) attacks and decrease the likelihood of data being compromised.
Toxic Language Detection
Data Demasking
Feedback Framework
Audit Trail

Typically, OpenAI wants to retain prompts and prompt responses for a period of time to monitor for abuse. OpenAI’s incredibly powerful LLMs check to see if anything unusual is happening to their models—like the prompt injection attacks that you learned about in the last unit. But our zero data retention policy prevents the LLM partners from retaining any data from the interaction. We arrived at an agreement where we handle that moderation.
