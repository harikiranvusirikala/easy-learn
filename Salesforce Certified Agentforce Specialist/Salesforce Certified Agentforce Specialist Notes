Get Started with Artificial Intelligence Basics
===
Main Types of AI Capabilities
  Language Processing
  Numeric Predictions
  Classifications
  Robotic Navigation
  AI Models and Neural Networks

Artificial intelligence is the ability for a computer to perform skills typically associated with human intuition, inference, and reasoning. Many of these skills fall into broad categories like numeric predictions and language processing that are making their way into our lives through AI that supports our business use cases, educational needs, and industrial purposes.

Possibilities of Language Models (LLMs)
  Summarization
  Translation
  Error Correction
  Question Answering
  Guided Image Generation
  Text-to-Speech

Factors
  availability of huge amounts of training data
  better training
  computational power

Common Concerns About Generative AI
  Hallucinations
  Data Security
  Plagiarism
  User Spoofing
  Sustainability

Generative AI is capable of assisting businesses and individuals alike with all sorts of language-based tasks. The convergence of lots of data, clever AI architecture, and huge amounts of computing power has supercharged generative AI development and the growth of the AI ecosystem.

Data processed from unstructured to structured is called natural language understanding (NLU).
Data processed the reverse way–from structured to unstructured–is called natural language generation (NLG). NLG is what enables AI assistants to generate human-like language.
Neural networks recognize patterns, words, and phrases to make language processing exponentially faster and more contextually accurate.

Elements of natural language in English include:
  Vocabulary: The words we use
  Grammar: The rules governing sentence structure
  Syntax: How words are combined to form sentences according to grammar
  Semantics: The meaning of words, phrases, and sentences
  Pragmatics: The context and intent behind cultural or geographic language use
  Discourse and dialogue: Units larger than a single phrase or sentence, including documents and conversations
  Phonetics and phonology: The sounds we make when we communicate
  Morphology: How parts of words can be combined or uncombined to make new words

Syntactic parsing may include:
  Segmentation
  Tokenization
  Stemming
  Lemmatization
  Part of speech tagging
  Named entity recognition (NER)

Common analysis techniques, used in extracting valuable insights from text and speech data, that are used in NLP:
  Sentiment analysis
  Intent analysis
  Context (discourse) analysis

LLMs are advanced computer models designed to understand and generate human-like text. They're trained on vast amounts of text data to learn patterns, language structures, and relationships between words and sentences.

LLMs vary by size, but they typically contain billions of parameters. Parameters are the factors that the model learns during its training process, building the model’s understanding of language.

Artificial Intelligence Technologies
  Machine learning uses various mathematical algorithms to get insights from data and make predictions.
  Deep learning uses a specific type of algorithm called a neural network to find associations between a set of inputs and outputs. Deep learning becomes more effective and efficient as the amount of data increases.
  Natural language processing is a technology that enables machines to take human language as an input and perform actions accordingly.
  Large language models are advanced computer models designed to understand and generate humanlike text.
  Computer vision is technology that enables machines to interpret visual information.
  Robotics is a technology that enables machines to perform physical tasks.

Machine learning (ML) classification
  Supervised learning
  Unsupervised learning
  Reinforcement learning

Limitations of Machine Learning
  Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization.
  Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple and does not capture the underlying patterns in the data.
  Bias occurs when the model is trained on data that is not representative of the real-world population.

Machine learning is limited by the quality and quantity of data used, lack of transparency in complex models, difficulty in generalizing to new situations, challenges with handling missing data, and potential for biased predictions.

Predictive AI
  Can make accurate predictions based on labeled data
  Can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and customer churn prediction
  Limited by the quality and quantity of labeled data available
  May struggle with making predictions outside of the labeled data it was trained on
  May require significant computational resources to train and deploy
Generative AI
  Can generate new and creative content
  Can be used in a wide range of creative applications, such as art, music, and writing
  Can generate biased or inappropriate content based on the input data
  May struggle with understanding context or generating coherent content
  May not be suitable for all applications, such as those that require accuracy and precision

Limitations of Generative AI
may generate biased or inappropriate responses based on the data it was trained on.
may also struggle with understanding user input context or generating coherent responses

Data Lifecycle for AI
  Data collection: In this stage, data is collected from various sources, such as sensors, surveys, and online sources.
  Data storage: Once data is collected, it must be stored securely.
  Data processing: In this stage, data is processed to extract insights and patterns. This may include using machine learning algorithms or other data analysis techniques.
  Data use: Once the data has been processed, it can be used for its intended purpose, such as making decisions or informing policy.
  Data sharing: At times, it may be necessary to share data with other organizations or individuals.
  Data retention: Data retention refers to the length of time that data is kept.
  Data disposal: Once data is no longer needed, it needs to be disposed of securely. This may involve securely deleting digital data or destroying physical media.

Some examples of ethical issues in data collection and analysis
  Privacy violations
  Data breaches
  Bias

Strategies to promote data privacy and confidentiality
  Encryption
  Anonymization
  Access controls

Addressing bias and promoting fairness requires a range of strategies
  Diversifying data sources
  Improving data quality
  Conducting bias audits
  Incorporating fairness metrics
  Promoting transparency

Data protection laws and regulations
  The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA): A set of regulations that apply to companies that do business in California and collect the personal data of California residents.
  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): A set of regulations that apply to healthcare organizations and govern the use and disclosure of protected health information in the United States.
  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A set of regulations that apply to all organizations that process the personal data of European Union residents.
  European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act): Comprehensive AI regulations banning systems with unacceptable risk and giving specific legal requirements for high-risk applications.

Best Practices for Data Lifecycle Management

Prompt Fundamentals
===
Basic Ingredients of a Prompt
  Participants - Describe who’s sending and receiving the model’s output.
  Setting - Give the model contextual information.
  Goal - Describe what you hope to achieve with the model’s output.
  Relationships - Describe the relationship between the participants involved. Also mention how the model’s output relates to the participants.
  Data - Give the model data to work with.
  Instructions - Tell the LLM what type of content you want and what it must include.
  Limits - To prevent hallucinating, give the model guardrails that it must stay within.
  Language  -Tell the model what language to generate output in.
  Style & Tone - Give the model style and tone guidelines to follow.

Example
==
You are a world-renowned cake decorator and you have a well-loved bakery known for its cakes. You also have a popular blog read by your customers. Your customers include families, newlyweds, and children. Your customers have a sweet tooth and are always curious about new cakes you make with fresh methods. You are writing your latest blog post. You want to capture customers’ attention while teaching them about unique decorating techniques.

You must follow the given instructions. You must not address any content or generate answers that you don’t have data on or basis for.

Instructions:

Write an informative article about cake decorating fundamentals. Include a comprehensive analysis of different cake decorating techniques. Discuss the tradeoffs and explore the challenges of different techniques. Include a call to action to see the techniques in action by trying my new cake that incorporates all of the techniques discussed in the blog post.

Write the blog in English. The blog must be written at an 8th grade reading level and leverage adjectives to evoke imagery in the prose. Use brief, declarative sentences in an active voice. Strictly avoid using filler words, slang, and redundant language. The blog must be less than 600 words.

Now, write the blog post.

Use merge fields to connect your prompt templates to Salesforce record fields, such as from sales or service records.
Use Flow Builder to create dynamic prompt fragments that go way beyond linking record fields. Flows let you add complex logic to a prompt that helps you include exactly the data you need.

Ask the Right Questions when preparing Prompt Template
  Who is involved, and how are they related? [Key Ingredients: Participants, relationships, data]
  What are you trying to accomplish? [Key Ingredients: Goal, instructions]
  What is the context? [Key Ingredients: Setting, tone & style, language]
  What are the constraints? [Key Ingredients: Limits, instructions]

Prompt Builder
Templates
  Sales Email prompt templates - help your team draft truly personalized emails for your customers, products, and events based on record data.
  Field Generation prompt templates - bring generative AI-assisted workflows to custom fields within a Salesforce record.
  Record Summary prompt templates - create a rich-text summary for a Salesforce record based on the record’s data.
  Flex prompt templates - generate content for business purposes not covered by other prompt template types, allowing you to define your own resources.

Grounding is a technique used in large language models to provide external, verifiable information to the model, which helps ensure that the prompt responses are accurate, relevant, and specific to the given context, rather than relying solely on the model's pre-existing training data.

To create a sales email prompt template in Prompt Builder, you need the Einstein for Sales, Einstein for Platform, or Einstein for Service add-on.

Use merge fields, Apex, and Flow as resources to enable Prompt Builder to securely access Salesforce data.

If you want to use data from a SOQL query or an external API in your prompt, consider Apex. Apex is also effective if you want to generate well-formatted JSON or do programmatic data filtering.

With the help of Lightning App Builder (LAB), an Einstein button (“Einstein button icon”) can trigger an assigned prompt template to send a prompt to the LLM and return a response back to the specific field.

Flow Builder, admins can create Template-Triggered Prompt Flows to incorporate complex logic in prompt templates without writing any code.

Considerations After Generating a Prompt Response / Guardrails
  Topical Relevance - The model’s response must be grammatically correct within the ongoing conversation and directly relevant with the overall request in the prompt.
  Action/Goal Completion - Assess if the response aligns with the intended action, fulfills the goal of the prompt, and satisfies the user's need by addressing everything the prompt requests.
  Register/Tonal Appropriateness - When evaluating model output, consider whether the tone of voice or style is appropriate for the interaction between the response and the user. Ensure the vocabulary, punctuation, and style fit the needs of your end user.
  Factual Accuracy - When reviewing model output, watch for inaccuracies or hallucinations. Check if it correctly uses prompt data and avoids including unintended specifics.
  Repetition - Consider the extent of variation in the response for your specific use case. Evaluate whether it meets your expectations. Consider if repetitive vocabulary is acceptable for tighter compliance. Also, decide if it’s OK if multiple responses sound the same or use the same terms.
  Toxicity - Review the response for any potentially harmful content, such as offensive, disrespectful, or abusive language that could negatively impact the user experience.
  Bias/Ethics "Verify that the response promotes fairness and inclusivity.
  Examine the response for subtle biases in language. Ensure it doesn’t:
    Assume gender identity based on their name alone.
    Sideline participants with disabilities.
    Display assumptions about race or socioeconomic status."

Data Masking
  Data masking for LLMs is currently disabled for agents.
  For embedded generative AI features, such as Einstein Service Replies, Einstein Work Summaries data masking is available.
Prompt Defense
  can help protect from prompt injection(get around restrictions and attempt to perform tasks or manipulate the model’s output in ways that the model wasn’t designed to handle.) attacks and decrease the likelihood of data being compromised.
Toxic Language Detection
Data Demasking
Feedback Framework
Audit Trail

Typically, OpenAI wants to retain prompts and prompt responses for a period of time to monitor for abuse. OpenAI’s incredibly powerful LLMs check to see if anything unusual is happening to their models—like the prompt injection attacks that you learned about in the last unit. But our zero data retention policy prevents the LLM partners from retaining any data from the interaction. We arrived at an agreement where we handle that moderation.

Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence
===
Three types of reasoning.
  Deduction: “All fruits have seeds. A mango is a fruit. Therefore, a mango has seeds.” (Starts with a general rule and applies it to a specific case.)
  Induction: “The last five meetings started late. So, the next one will probably start late too.” (Looks at patterns in past experience to make a general prediction.)
  Abduction: “The lights are off and no one's answering the door—so they’re probably not home.” (Takes the best guess based on limited clues.)

Four popular strategies that guide LLMs
  Breaking problems into steps (CoT), interacting with feedback (ReAct), exploring multiple options (ToT), or simulating future states (RAP), each approach makes AI feel a little more like human reasoning–only faster!

How Agentforce Deploys LLM Reasoning
Here’s what happens step by step.
  A user types in a request, for example,“Build a webpage.”
  Agentforce sends that input to a secure LLM using a carefully designed prompt. This helps the LLM translate the user’s input into a defined need that the AI understands.
  Once the intent is clear, another prompt asks the LLM to create a plan to get it done.
  The LLM responds with a step-by-step plan. This plan is built only from actions that an agent is allowed to take, ensuring safe and trusted behavior.
  The agent follows the steps, executes the actions in the right order, and delivers the result back to the user.

Agentforce gives companies a bold new capability: It turns large language models into real-time reasoning engines. That means AI isn’t just answering questions, it’s making sense of complex scenarios, planning next steps, and taking action.

Atlas Reasoning Engine is the “brain” behind Agentforce, the agentic layer of the Salesforce Platform.

4 key concepts
  Reason–act–observe Loop (ReAct): Atlas uses a cycle of reasoning, acting, and observing. It thinks through a step, takes action, checks the outcome, and loops until it completes the user’s goal. If needed, it even asks for clarification mid-task. This keeps conversations natural and accurate.
  Topic classification: Every request is mapped to a topic, which serves as the AI’s job description for that moment. Topics define what actions are valid and which policies apply. This helps Atlas scale safely across thousands of scenarios.
  Richer conversations: Unlike earlier bots, Atlas allows Agentforce to respond in natural language, handle follow-up questions, and pull from past conversational context. The result? A smoother, more human-like interaction.
  Visible reasoning: Atlas shares its "thoughts"–the reasoning behind why it acted a certain way–so that admins can review decisions, prevent errors, and build trust. You can access those insights in Agent Builder.

3 key capabilities
  Proactive actions: Agents don’t wait for you; they can trigger actions when CRM data changes, or an email arrives, or a meeting is upcoming.
  Dynamic information retrieval: Atlas pulls in the most relevant data–both structured and unstructured–from Salesforce Data 360, web searches, or internal docs. That means more accurate responses and richer actions from AI agents.
  Seamless human handoff: If Atlas hits a tough question or a strict business rule, it smoothly hands the conversation to a real human, so there's no drop in customer experience.

The Atlas Reasoning Engine transforms AI from reactive to reasoning. It listens, thinks, decides, and acts with purpose. It retrieves smart data, adapts to changes, involves users when needed, and explains its choices.

Introduction to Agentforce Builder
- https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/introduction-to-agent-builder

Agentforce Builder is the low-code tool where you build your Agentforce and choose options that define each agent’s role, unique skills, access, and settings that qualify them for the jobs you want them to do.

Agentforce Builder helps you create and deploy your Agentforce to the places your employees or customers need them, like Slack, your CRM, or your website.

From Agentforce Studio, you can view your Agent Actions library, access your agents and learning resources, or launch the Agentforce Testing Center.

Agentforce Builder guides you through four screens
  Select Type: Choose a preconfigured agent type that aligns with the skills your agent needs to do its job. Or create a brand-new agent from scratch. The agent type you select influences the topics and actions available to your agent.
  Review Topics: Add or remove predefined topics, which are the categories of jobs an agent can do. Some topics include predefined actions, which are the individual tasks or jobs your agent is able to perform, like processing an order return, or summarizing an account. Actions can call flows, prompt builder templates, or invocable Apex.
  Define Settings/Customize Your Agent: Name and describe your agent, define its role, and tell the agent about your company. Select an agent user that has the necessary permissions to access the information it needs to do its job. You can configure permissions for a new agent user in User Settings. You can also enrich event logs with conversation data to help you test and troubleshoot your agent.
  Select Data: If Data 360 is enabled in your org, you can choose to upload data like your knowledge articles, or other information for your agents to reference to provide more personalized responses. However, many kinds of agents don’t require data at all.

Three key foundations of Agentforce for Service
  Topics
  Actions
    Standard actions included might be considered private actions, potentially needing additional configuration per your security standards to function correctly.

    An agent action can be created manually from an Apex class, a flow, or a prompt template.
    Apex: An action that uses Apex can call classes and variables, enabling it to interact with third-party APIs or external applications. Apex is ideal for handling complex logic or enforcing intricate business rules.
    Flows: are used to create, update, delete, and retrieve records. Flow Builder enables automation of processes and actions within specific topics. Existing flows can also be referenced by agent actions.
    Prompt templates: can be invoked as Agentforce actions to help agents handle queries such as knowledge search, classification, and more. A prompt template directs the LLM on what and how to respond, including the ability to choose your own model. Similar to flows, Agentforce can employ prebuilt prompt templates.
  Instructions

Actions/tasks that can be considered private, such as updating personal appointment details, making purchases, or requesting services on a support contract, require further configuration before the agent can be deployed.

Use cases for standard topics and actions

Custom Topics and Actions - if more personalized approach is needed to engage with customers, complete tasks, and deliver responses that perfectly match brand and tone.
Use cases for custom topics and actions

Agentforce Data Library
Adding an Agentforce Data Library enhances accuracy and builds customer trust in the responses provided.
The Data Library supports both Knowledge articles (records and fields) uploaded files, web search, and custom retrievers.

Agentforce harnesses the power of large language models (LLMs) to process unstructured data, supported by the Agentforce Data Library. Unstructured data often includes chat transcripts, PDFs, audio and video files, legal documents, and large text files like books.
In Salesforce, this type of data can be sourced from Knowledge articles or PDF attachments when integrating an Agentforce Data Library.

The data library uses grounding with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to index Knowledge articles and attachments, ensuring it retrieves the most relevant and up-to-date information. When a data library is added in Agentforce, Salesforce automatically builds a RAG-powered solution to retrieve unstructured (and structured data) from Knowledge articles and PDFs. With this indexed data, Einstein can quickly fact-check responses against specific policies and information.

Data 360 needs to be activated before setting up a Data Library.
